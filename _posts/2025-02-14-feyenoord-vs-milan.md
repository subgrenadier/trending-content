For Malaysian fans, many of whom grew up idolizing players like Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit (who graced Feyenoord later in his career), and Franco Baresi, these clubs hold a special place in our hearts.  We remember waking up early to catch these European giants in action, their names etched into our footballing consciousness.
